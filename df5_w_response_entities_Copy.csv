To develop a new drug, a candidate compound is assessed for its efficacy and unwanted effects on the human body by using cells or animals first. However, those results are not sufficient for the compound to be used in human for the treatment of disease because the physical structures are different between human and animals. Therefore, after various effects and safety are assessed in animal studies, further research studies are necessary to investigate the efficacy and unwanted effects in many healthy volunteers and patients based on a plan in full accordance with safety and scientific principles as well as respect for human rights.",,,yes,yes,"In order for a new drug to be commonly used in hospitals, it needs to be approved by domestic and foreign regulatory authorities based on its efficacy (desired effects) and safety.

Genomic (DNA/RNA) testing will be used to identify specific genetic variants that could show your cancer risk, how well your cancer might respond to treatment, and which treatments might work best in your body. DNA is the material in a cell that carries all the information about how a living thing will look and function. This is known as genetic information.
