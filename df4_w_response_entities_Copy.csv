Why is this study being done?,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) has begun a study of an investigational treatment of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab followed by nivolumab alone as a possible treatment for advanced liver cancer. An investigational treatment is one that has not been approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For this study, researchers are studying the clinical benefit, long-term safety and survival data of the investigational treatment (nivolumab with ipilimumab followed by nivolumab alone) in participants with advanced liver cancer who have not previously received a drug treatment for this disease. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are types of immunotherapy that work by encouraging the body's own immune system to attack the cancer cells. The main purpose of this study is to learn how well the investigational treatment works and how safe it is compared with other therapies that have already been FDA approved (standard of care treatments), in this case, sorafenib or lenvatinib.",,,yes,yes,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) has begun a study of an investigational treatment of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab followed by nivolumab alone as a possible treatment for advanced liver cancer.
